1. Stdint.h provides a number of new integer types which are guaranteed to be consistent across different systems and environments.

2. Using a data type like uint32_t enables a program to standardize the size of such data type across different platforms; such that a DWORD, for instance, will always be 32 bits across all platforms.

3. A BYTE is 1 byte; a DWORD is 4 bytes; a LONG is 4 bytes; and a WORD is 2 bytes, respectively.

4. The first two bytes of a BMP file are 0x42 and 0x4D in hexadecimal, which are equivalent to B and M respectively in ASCII.

5. bfSize denotes the size of an entire bmp file, whereas biSize refers to the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, which is consistenly 14 bytes in size.

6. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap originates at the upper left corner and populates its pixels in a top-down manner.

7. The field biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel.

8. fopen will return NULL if the function somehow fails to access the target file; this can happen for a number of reasons, such as the target file being corrupted or if the user accidentally put in the wrong file path. 

9. Passing 1 as the third argument to fread ensures that the program only reads BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER once and once only.

10. If bi.biWidth is 3, copy.c will assign to padding the value of 3.

11. fseek allows a program to skip over part of a file and start reading the file from a specific section, as specified by the offset.

12. Passing SEEK_CUR as an argument to fseek changes the location of the file pointer from its current location.
